<h1 align="center">ClaimIt</h1>
<h5 align="center">A mod for claiming land in Forge 1.12</h5>

# Why is this mod special?
This mod is built with the idea of creating easy compatibility that allows mods to integrate properly with the claiming system to avoid the need for banning items.

In the future I will make a documentation on this - It's currently unreleased and still in development. It is functional aside from a few QoL things and minor issues (fluids, pistons)
