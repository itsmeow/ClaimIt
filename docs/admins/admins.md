# Admins

Admins can be treated with special permissions, so checking them is sometimes useful to allow bypasses. By default a permission check includes an admin check, but sometimes you may need to so manually.

## Checking for Admins

`AdminManager.isAdmin(EntityPlayer);`

## Adding Admins

`AdminManager.addAdmin(EntityPlayer);`

## Removing Admins

`AdminManager.removeAdmin(EntityPlayer);`

## Clearing Admins

`AdminManager.clearAdmins();`
