1.0.1
-
 - Fixed bug where non-ops couldn't make claims without sponge installed (ok, I'm really sorry for this one, I swear, I thought it worked)
 - Fixed bug where claims could have duplicate names
 - Added a toggle for fake player permission bypass (on by default)
 - Added a toggle for creating fire on obsidian (on by default, for nether portals)
 - Fixed server config forces not being applied until a toggle is set with the command, it now forces on EVERY check
 - Added claim blocks playtime accrual system (see claimit.cfg)
 - Moved user config data to api data. Sorry for any data loss, but I don't think claim border display options are important right now.
